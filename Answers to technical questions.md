#### 1.How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solutions if you had more time?
About 24 hours (non-consecutives!!!)

#### 2.Why did you choose the language you used for the coding test?
It is the language requested in the job offer and, coincidentally, it is in which I feel more comfortable at the moment.
#### 3.What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?
asyncio is now a stable module (it was provisional until 3.6)
#### 4 How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Logging, logging logging everywhere!!! If you can't measure it it doesn't exist.
Yes, in my last company we had a server running OPENERP connected to a client portal (django). In each functionality that was added, performance measurements were made during the first week after the change.
